# RGC-GRF-Proposal-Template
A minimalistic template for typesetting and formatting proposal submitted to HK RGC GRF (https://www.ugc.edu.hk/doc/eng/rgc/form/GRF2.pdf)
### Caveats
- This is mainly for my own convenience. Please use at your own risk.
- There are many unspecified requirements on the typesetting and formatting of submission materials. The current template is only designed for my personal preferences.
